He became a lone crusader against the international Ivory trade which was finally banned in 1989.

Decades later, during the making of The Sparrow Dream, I re-filmed these two film strips on my editing table and objects associated with her, such as a wooden tray that she had carved. She was the first person to explain to me what an artist might be and in teaching me how to carve wood, I learned how to go with the grain or against it”",0.664,/yt29169yLUedaKxN7Oj6hp7RYRP.jpg,2024-09-09,Dedication: Bernice Hodges,False,0.0,0
